# HELP_International_Country_Data - PRML Project.
HELP International Country Data - Unsupervised Learning to categorize the countries using socio-economic and health factors.

## Country Clustering Analysis using Unsupervised Learning -
Analyzing socio-economic and health factors of countries worldwide to classify and group them. This repository contains an IPython notebook and a detailed report showcasing the application of unsupervised learning techniques for country categorization. In the notebook, we explore the data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering algorithms, and insightful visualizations in this project.

The accompanying report in this repository provides a comprehensive overview of the "Country Clustering Analysis using Unsupervised Learning" project. The report delves into the process of categorizing countries based on socio-economic and health factors, employing various unsupervised learning techniques.

## Key components of the report include:
Introduction: A clear introduction to the project, explaining the significance of categorizing countries and the use of unsupervised learning.

Dataset Description: An overview of the HELP International country dataset, detailing the attributes and variables used in the analysis.

Data Preprocessing: A thorough explanation of the data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling.

Feature Engineering: Discussion of any feature engineering techniques applied to enhance the dataset's suitability for clustering.

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: Description and application of the unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering, such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN.

Results and Interpretation: Presentation of the clustering results, along with insightful interpretations of the country clusters formed based on socio-economic and health factors.

Visualizations: Inclusion of informative visualizations, such as scatter plots, dendrogram diagrams, or cluster distribution charts, to visually represent the clustering outcomes.

Conclusion: A summary of the findings, implications of the analysis, and potential real-world applications of the clustered country groups.

Readers of the report will gain a deeper understanding of the entire process, from data preprocessing to clustering algorithms, and will be able to grasp the insights drawn from the unsupervised learning analysis of country data. The report serves as a comprehensive guide to the project's methodology, results, and implications.
